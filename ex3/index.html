<title>Example 3: Perfusion Analysis using multi-PLD pcASL</title>
</head>

<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 3: Perfusion Analysis using multi-PLD pcASL</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this example is to analyse data that has been
  acquired with mulitple post-labeling delays. The analysis is on data
  from the same subject (and the same session) as used in <a href="../ex1/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a>  and <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>. This example
  uses the data first met in Chapter 4 of the primer.</p>

   <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these
  exercises.</p>
  
  <p>For this example you should use the Multi-PLD pcASL data, you
  will also need images from the Single-PLD pcASL data. The multi-PLD pcASL data was acquired using a label duration of 1.4 seconds and PLDs of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
  1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 seconds. </p>

  <h2>Perfusion Quantification </h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 4.1)</h3>

<p>We can proceed to do the full quantification using a single call to
  <code>oxford_asl</code> as we did in Example 1 and 2. We will copy
  the approach we took in  <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a> and include motion and distortion
  correction, and we will use CSF as the reference tissue for
  calibration purposes:
</p>

<pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --casl --iaf=tc \
  --tis=1.65,1.9,2.15,2.4,2.65,2.9 --bolus=1.4 --slicedt=0.0452 \
  --fixbolus --artoff --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cmethod=single --csf=csfmask --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095
  </pre>

  <p><list>Note that:
  <li>The different PLD are provided as a comma separated list of
  inflow times <code>--tis=1.65,1.9,2.15,2.4,2.65,2.9</code>.</li>
  <li>We haven't defined an ATT (the <code>--bat=</code> option isn't
  used), this parameter will be infered from the data. For multi-PLD
  data the <code>--bat=</code> option can be used to set the initial (and
  prior) value for this parameter, but it is always estimated from the
  data. We do not set it here as we are happy with the default value
  (1.3 seconds) provided.</li>
  <li>We have explicitly told <code>oxford_asl</code> not to estimate an arterial
  (macrovascular) component, <code>--artoff</code>. When we only had
  single PLD data this didn't matter, as there isn't information in
  single PLD ASL to estimate such a component, but it might be
  posisble to infer from multi-PLD data - something we will return to
  below.</li>
  <li>We have explicitly told <code>oxford_asl</code> to use the
  reference region approach and supplied a CSF mask (in the same space
  as the ASL data). If we hadn't it would use the voxelwise method. We
  could, as we did in Example 2, supply the structural image, but it
  is quicker to supply an existing CSF mask in this case (to save
  repeating the registration of ASL to structural image). This CSF
  mask is simply the result of a previous run of oxford_asl on this
  subject, as we generated in  <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>.</li>
  </list></p>

  <p>The results directory from this analysis should look similar to
  that obtained in  <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>. The main difference is that the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image is now a genuine estimate of
  ATT;if you examine this image you should find a pattern of values
  consitent with the time it takes for blood to transit between the
  labeling to imaging regions. You might notice that the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image was present even in the single-PLD
  results, but if you looked at it contained a single value - the one
  provided by the <code>--bat=</code> option - which meant that it
  appeared blank in that case.</p>

  <h2>Arterial/Macrovascular Signal Correction</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 4.2)</h3>

  <p>In the analysis above we prevented <code>oxford_asl</code> from
  including an extra component in the model that would capture any
  arterial (macrovascular) signal present in the data. This is fairly
  reasonable for pcASL in general, since we can only start sampling
  some time after the first arrival of labeled blood-water in the
  imaging region. However, given we are using shorter PLD in our
  multi-PLD sampling to improve the SNR there is a much greater
  likelihood of arterial signal being present. Thus, we might like to
  repeat the analysis with this component included:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --casl --iaf=tc \
  --tis=1.65,1.9,2.15,2.4,2.65,2.9 --bolus=1.4 --slicedt=0.0452 \
  --fixbolus --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cmethod=single --csf=csfmask --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095
  </pre>

  <p>All we did in this run was remove the <code>--artoff</code>
  option. The results directory should be almost identical to the
  previous run, but now we also gain some new results:
  <code>aCBV.nii.gz</code> and
  <code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code>; follwing the convention for the
  perfusion images, these are the relative and absolute arterial
  (cerebral) blood volumes respectively. If you examine one of these
  and focus on the more inferior slices you should see a pattern of
  higher values that map out the strcture of the major arterial
  vasculature, including the Circle of Willis. This finding of an
  arterial contirbution in some voxels rsults in a correction to the
  perfusion image - you may now be able to spot that in the same
  slices where there was some evidence for arterial contamination of
the perfusion image before that has now been removed.</p>

<h2>Partial Volume Correction</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 6.4)</h3>
<p>In the same way that we could use <code>oxford_asl</code> for
partial volume correction in <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a> for single PLD pcASL, we can do this
for multi-PLD:</p>

<pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --casl --iaf=tc \
  --tis=1.65,1.9,2.15,2.4,2.65,2.9 --bolus=1.4 --slicedt=0.0452 \
  --fixbolus --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cmethod=single --csf=csfmask --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095 \
--fslanat=T1.anat --pvcorr
</pre>

<p>Note that we need to provide partial volume estimates and we have
thus used the T1.anat result from <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>. In practice we do not need to
supply the CSF mask in this case.</p>

<p>The results directory now containes, as a further subdirectory, <code>pvcorr</code>,
within the <code>native_space</code> subdirectory, the partial volume
corrected results: gray matter (<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code>
etc) and white matter perfusion
(<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code> etc)
maps. Alongside these there are also gray and white matter ATT maps
(<code>arrival</code> and <code>arrival_wm</code> respectively). The
estimated maps for the arterial component
(<code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code> etc) are still present in the
<code>pvcorr</code> directory. Since this is not tissue specific there
are not separate gray and white matter versions of this parameter.</p>

<h2>ADVANCED: ASL data manipulation</h2>

<p>In  <a href="../ex1/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> we firstly manipulated the data using
  <code>asl_file</code> to examine the perfusion-weighted image and
  satisfy ourselevs that there was perfusion information in the
  data. We can use <code>asl_file</code> with multi-PLD pcASL (or
  almost any other ASL variant). For example, if we wanted to perform
tag-control subtraction we could do as follows:</p>

<pre class="bash">
  asl_file --data=asltc --ntis=6 --iaf=tc --ibf=tis --diff --out=asldiffdata --mean=asldiffdata_mean
</pre>

<p>We have to be careful to do is specify the number of
PLD (TI) in the data: <code>--nti=6</code>. The
<code>asldiffdata_mean.nii.gx</code> contains result of averaging all
the repeats of each invidiual PLD - thus it contains 6 separate
volumes; if you examine these you should see that the first volume is
relatively bright compared to the last couple of volumes. This
reflects that fact that at the first PLD most (but not all) of the
brain has recieved labelled blood-water and thus there is quite a lot
of perfusion signal. By the time of the later PLD the end of the bolus
of labeled blood-water has already reached every part of the brain and
T1 decay is gradually reducing the signal. If you examine the
<code>asldiffdata.nii.gz</code> file you will find it contains the
noisy label-control difference images.</p>

<p>Note that we have also told <code>asl_file</code> the oder in which
the PLD are to be found in the data: <code>--ibf=tis</code>. They were
aquired as a full set of PLDs first, followed by another repeat of all
the PLDs etc. It is possible, but less common, that we could have
acquired all the repeats for a single PLD first, then all at the next
PLD etc.</p>

<p>In this example the early PLDs are a pretty good basis on which to
examine if the data contains perfusion information. However, this
might be less reliable if we have fewer repeats at each PLD where the
influence of noise at each PLD would be more noticable. We can
generate a very simple perfusion-weighted image by averaing all the
PLD:</p>

<pre class="bash">
  fslmaths asldiffdata_mean -Tmean aslpwi
</pre>

<p>There are various other things we can do with <code>asl_file</code>
to mainpulate the data; for example, splitting the data into separate
files for each PLD using the <code>--split</code> option, or output
the data having changed the oder in which the repeated PLDs appear in
the data according to the pattern using the <code>--out</code> option
with <code>--obf</code>. For more information see the help for <code>asl_file</code>.</p>
