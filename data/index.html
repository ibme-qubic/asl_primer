<title>ASL Data for Examples</title>

<h1 class="centred">ASL Data for Examples</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Here you will find all of the data you will need to run the
  examples associated with the primer: Introduction to Perfusion
  Quantification using Arterial Spin Labelling.</p>
  <p>Please note that the data is provided for training purposes and
  should not be used for research without permission.</p>

  <h2>Single PLD pcASL</h2>
  <p>This dataset uses pcASL labeling and a single post-labeling
  delay. This dataset follows as closely as posisble the
  recommendations of the ASL Consensus Paper on a good general purpose
  ASL acquisition, although we have chosen to use a 2D mutli-slice
  readout rather than a full-volume 3D readout.</p>

  <p><list>The files contained in the archive are:
  <li><code>asltc.nii.gz</code> - the label-control ASL series containing 60
  volumes. That is 30 label and 30 control in pairs of alternating images with
  label first, for BASIL tools this is <code>--iaf=tc</code>.</li>
  <li><code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> - the calibration image, a (largely) proton-density
  weighted image with the same readout (resolution etc) as the main
  ASL data. The TR for this data is 4.8 seconds, which means there
  will be some T1 weighting.</li>
  <li><code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code> - another calibration image,
  identical to <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> apart from the use of
  posterior-anterior phase encoding (anterior-posterior was used in
  the rest of the ASL data). This is provided for distortion
  correction.</li>
  <li><code>T1.nii.gz</code> - the T1-weigthed anatomical of the same
  subject.</li>
  </list>

  <h2>Multi PLD pcASL</h2>
  <p>This data supplements the Single PLD pcASL one above, adding
  mutli-PLD ASL data in the same subject (collected in the same
  session). This dataset used the same pcASL labelling, but with a
  label duration of 1.4 seconds and 6 post-labelling delays of 0.25,
  0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 seconds.</p>

  <p><list>The files contained in the archive are:
  <li><code>asltc.nii.gz</code> - the label-control ASL series
  containing 96 volumes: each PLD was repeated 8 times, thus there are
  16 volumes (label and control paired) for each PLD. The order in
  which these was collected was a full set of PLD, followed
  by another, etc. For <code>asl_file</code> this is the same as
  setting <code>--ibf=tis</code> - the data is grouped as repeats of
  the whole set of PLDs (TIs).</li>
  <li><code>csfmask.nii.gz</code> - a mask, in the same space as the
  ASL data, of the ventricles for use in calibration. This is simply
  the result of previously running <code>oxford_asl</code> on the data
  and is provided to save time when running the examples.</li>
  </list></p>

  </pre>

  <h2> Group ASL data</h2>
  <p>This data contains the subset of measurements made from a group
  of eight subjects (but we only use seven here) both at rest and when
  subject to visual plus motor stimulation. The acquisition was almost
  identical to the Multi PLD pcASL data.</p>

  <p><list>the files contained in the archive are:
  <li><code>subject1</code> - a subdirectory containing the data from
  one subject that inlcudes: <code>rest.nii.gz</code> pcASL data
  during resting, <code>task.nii.gz</code> pcASL data when stimulation
  was being applied, <code>calibration_head.nii.gz</code> a
  calibration image with a TR of 6 seconds,
  <code>calibration_body.nii.gz</code> a calibration image (TR 6
  seconds) using the body coil to permit correction for coil
  sensitivity, <code>T1.anat</code> the T1 strucutral image having
  been analysed using <code>fsl_anat</code>.</li>
  <li><code>perfusion_study.nii.gz</code> - perfusion images from
  seven individuals both at rest and during stimulation combined into
  a single image in MNI152 standard space.</li>
  <li><code>design.*</code> - design matrix files for statistical
  inference, created with <code>Glm<code>.</li>
