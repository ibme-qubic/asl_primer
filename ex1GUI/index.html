<title>Example 1: Simple Perfusion Analysis using pcASL (GUI)</title>
</head>

<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 1: Simple Perfusion Analysis using pcASL (GUI)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to perform a very simple analysis
  of ASL data to produce a perfusion image as an introduction to using
  ASL, esentially following the procedure outlined in Chapter 1 of the
  Primer using the <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BASIL"
  target="dynamic">BASIL</a> GUI in FSL. There is a similar example
  using the command line tools <a href="../ex1/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these exercises.</p>

  <p> For this exercise you should be using the Single PLD pcASL dataset
  set. This ASL data was acquired using pcASL labelling
  with a label duration of 1.8 seconds and a post-labelling delay
  (PLD) of 1.8 seconds, following the recommendations of the ASL
  consensus paper. </p>

  <pre class="listing">
<a href="../data/index.html" target="_blank">Get the data</a>
</pre>

  <h2>Look at the data</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.1)</h3>

  <p>It is always a good idea to take a look at the raw data just to
  check that nothing has gone horribly wrong in the acquisition and
  ensure you know exactly what you are dealing with. </p>
  <list> There are two
  separate files that contain the ASL data we need:
  <li>asltc - this contains 60 volumes and is repeated
  measurements of alternating label and control images (in that
  order).</li>
  <li>aslcalib - this is the calibration image (only a single volume),
  it is effectively a proton density image acquired with the same
  readout as the ASL data. In this case the TR was 4.8 seconds, which
  means there will be some T1 weighting that we might want to correct for.</li>
  </list>

<p>View these images in fsleyes:</p>
  
  <pre class="bash">
fsleyes aslcalib.nii.gz -dr 0 1500 asltc.nii.gz -dr 0 1500
  </pre>

  <p>
  <list>
  Notice that:
<li>There is a marked intensity difference between the calibration image and the label-control data. This is because background suppression was applied when acquiring the label-control data, as recommended by the ASL consensus paper, to reduce the influence of motion and physiological noise sources.</li>
<li>It is very hard to spot differecnes between label and control
  images - try using the movie mode of fsleyes, you might find it
  helpful to set the display range for the asltc.nii.gz image as 0 to
500 now.</li>
<li>There is an alternating pattern in the timeseries of the
  label-control data, but it is small compared to the mean signal
  intensity in any given voxel. To see this use the timeseries mode in
  fsleyes, you will need to choose a voxel in cotrical gray matter
  (where there will be the largest perfusion signal) e.g. [20,14,13].</li>
  </list>
  </p>

  <h2>A Perfusion-Weighted Image </h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.2)</h3>
<p>Since the data looks okay we can proceed to the calculation of a
  perfusion-weighted image (PWI). For this we will use the 'preview'
  feature of the BASIL GUI, essentially we are generating the PWI to check
  that the data is okay for further analysis.</p>

<p>  To launch the GUI at the command line you will need to type
  <code>asl_gui</code>. Note that if you have downloaded the
  'pre-release' yourself, you may need to provide a path to the
  installed version of the GUI, e.g. <code>/Users/{blah}/Downloads/oxford_asl/asl.gui</code></p>

  <p>Once it has launched you
  will find yourself on the 'Input Data' tab, you
  should:</p>
  <list>
  <li>Load the ASL data <code>asltc.nii.gz</code> as the 'Input
  Image'.</li>
  <li>Set the 'Number of PLDs', which in this case is 1, this is
  already done by default.</li>
  <li>Click the 'Update' button beneath the 'Data Preview' pane on the right.</li>
  </list>

  <p> At this point the GUI should look like the screen shot below and
  a PWI will have appeared in the 'Data Preview' pane. At this point
  in our analysis this is reassuring, if we didn't see something that
  looks roughly like this, we might check if the data order that the
  GUI is expecting matches that in the data. We could alter the 'Data
  order' settings if needed and update the preview again'. </p>

  <img src="PWI.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI previewing perfusion-weighted
  image" width=900>
  
  <p>Note also, beneath the 'Data Preview', that there is a 'Data order
  preview'. The idea of this graphic is to help visually to confirm
  that the way that the GUI is intepreting the ordering of volumes in
  the data matches what you are expecting. In this case we have a
  single PLD repeated 30 times with the label and control images
  paired in the data (this is pretty common). What the 'Data order
  preview' shows is the first instance of the PLD in purple, showing
  both the label and control (hatched) volume. Each subsequent repeat
  of the same PLD is coloured green, again showing that we have a
  label follwed by control (hatched) volume.</p>

  <p>You can try a different 'Data order' option to see what
  happens. Change 'Label/Control pairs' from 'Label then control' to
  'Control then label'. This switches the expected order of label and
  control images within the pair. If you then udpate the preview you
  will find that the contrast reverses, the perfusion now has the
  wrong 'sign'.
  </list>

  <h2>(Simple) Perfusion Quantification</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.3)</h3>
  <p>We have checked the PWI, thus we
  can proceed to final quantification of perfusion, inverting the
  kinetics of the ASL label delivery and using the calibration
image to get values in the units of ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>To do this we need to tell the BASIL GUI some information about the
  data and the analysis we want to perform.</p>

  <list>On the 'Input Data' tab we need to sepcify the 'Acquisition parameters':
  <li> Labelling - cASL/pcASL (the deafult option).</li>
  <li> Bolus duration (s) - 1.8 (default).</li>
  <li> PLDs (s) - 1.8 (default).</li>
  <li> Readout - 2D multi-slice (you will need to set this).</li>
  <li> Time per slice (ms) - 45.2 (only appears when you change the
  Readout option).</li>
  </list>

  <p>You can now hit 'Next' and you will be taken to the next tab. For
  this (simple) analysis we do not want to use a structural image, so
  we can move on by clicking 'Next' again. Or we could skip stright to
  the 'Calibration' tab using the menu across the top.</p>

  <p>On the 'Calibration' tab, 'Enable Calibration' first, then load
  the calibration image <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code>. Change the
  'Calibration mode' to 'voxelwise', and set the 'Sequence TR (s)' to
  be 4.8.</p>

  <img src="Calib.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Calibration" width=900>
  
  <p>Finally, we need to set the analysis options: either skip to the
  'Analysis' tab or click 'Next' twice.</p>

  <p>On the 'Analysis' tab, choose an output directory name, e.g.,
  <code>oxasl</code>. And, select 'Analysis which conforms to White
  Paper', so that we know the analysis is using the same default
  parameter values proposed in the ' ASL White Paper' quantification
  formula. Note that in the lower left corner the GUI is now telling
  us that we are 'Ready to Go'. At this point you can click 'Run' in
  the lower right corner.</p>

  <img src="Analysis.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>
  

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

  <p>Note that if you just supply a name for the output directory (not
  a full path), as we have here, this will be placed in the 'working
  directory', i.e. whicheveer directory you were in when you launched
  the GUI.</p>
  
<p>You will find something that looks very similar to the PWI we viewed before, but now the values at every voxel are in ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>You will also find a PWI saved as
<code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion</code>. This is very similar to the
PWI displayed in the preview pane, except that the kinetic
model inversion has been applied to it, this is the image
pre-calibration.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of the analysis of this data, by applying
some corrections during analysis, this is the subject of <a href="../ex2GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>.</p>
