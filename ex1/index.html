<title>Example 1: Simple Perfusion Analysis using pcASL</title>

<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 1: Simple Perfusion Analysis using pcASL</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to perform a very simple analysis
  of ASL data to produce a perfusion image as an introduction to using
  ASL, esentially following the procedure outlined in Chapter 1 of the
  Primer using the <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BASIL"
  target="dynamic">BASIL</a> tools in FSL.</p>

  <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these exercises.</p>

  <p> For this exercise you should using the Single PLD pcASL dataset
  set. This ASL data was acquired using pcASL labelling
  with a label duration of 1.8 seconds and a post-labelling delay
  (PLD) of 1.8 seconds, following the recommendations of the ASL
  consensus paper. </p>

  <pre class="listing">
<a href="../data/index.html" target="_blank">Get the data</a>
</pre>

  <h2>Look at the data</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.1)</h3>

  <p>It is always a good idea to take a look at the raw data just to
  check that nothing has gone horribly wrong in the acquisition and
  ensure you know exactly what you are dealing with. </p>
  <list> There are two
  separate files that contain the ASL data we need:
  <li>asltc - this contains 60 volumes and is repeated
  measurements of alternating label and control images (in that
  order).</li>
  <li>aslcalib - this is the calibration image (only a single volume),
  it is effectively a proton density image acquired with the same
  readout as the ASL data. In this case the TR was 4.8 seconds, which
  means there will be some T1 weighting that we might want to correct for.</li>
  </list>

<p>View these images in fsleyes:</p>
  
  <pre class="bash">
fsleyes aslcalib.nii.gz -dr 0 1500 asltc.nii.gz -dr 0 1500
  </pre>

  <p>
  <list>
  Notice that:
<li>There is a marked intensity difference between the calibration image and the label-control data. This is because background suppression was applied when acquiring the label-control data, as recommended by the ASL consensus paper, to reduce the influence of motion and physiological noise sources.</li>
<li>It is very hard to spot differecnes between label and control
  images - try using the movie mode of fsleyes, you might find it
  helpful to set the display range for the asltc.nii.gz image as 0 to
500 now.</li>
<li>There is an alternating pattern in the timeseries of the
  label-control data, but it is small compared to the mean signal
  intensity in any given voxel. To see this use the timeseries mode in
  fsleyes, you will need to choose a voxel in cotrical gray matter
  (where there will be the largest perfusion signal) e.g. [20,14,13].</li>
  </list>
  </p>

  <h2>A Perfusion-Weighted Image </h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.2)</h3>
<p>Since the data looks okay we can proceed to the calculation of a
  perfusion-weighted image (PWI). This can be achieved relatively simply by
  subtracting pairs of label and control iamges within the data and
  then averaging over all the resulting volumes. This will allow us to
  check that there is perfusion information in the data - as you might
  have gathered it is realtively easy for the data to look fine on
  first inspection, but hard to tell if there is going to be a
  perfusion image in there.</p>

  <p>To perform label control subtraction use
  <code>asl_file</code>:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  asl_file --data=asltc --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --out=asldiffdata --mean=asldiffdata_mean
  </pre>
  
  <p>Note that we have told <code>asl_file</code> that there is a
  single PLD (using <code>--ntis=1</code>, <code>asl_file</code> calls
  them TIs) and asked for two different outputs, one will contain all
  the different volumes after subtraction has been performed
  <code>asldiffdata</code> and the other will be the mean over all the
  volumes after subtraction <code>asldiffdata_mean</code>, i.e., the
  PWI.</p>

  <p>Look at both of these in FSLeyes:</p>
  
  <pre class="bash">
fsleyes asldiffdata.nii.gz asldiffdata_mean.nii.gz
  </pre>
  
  <p>The PWI (<code>asldiffdata_mean</code>) has the expected
  distirbution for perfusion in the brain - it looks reassuraingly
  like a perfusion image. If you now scroll through all the volumes in
  <code>asldiffdata</code> you will be able to observe how noisy ASL
  data is, but the perfusion pattern should still be visible in all
  the different volumes. It is interesting to also load the
  <code>aslcalib</code> file and compare the magnitude of voxels in
  that with the PWI - there is approximately a factor of 100
  difference.</p>

  <h2>(Simple) Perfusion Quantification</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 1.3)</h3>
  <p>We have checked the raw data and also checked the PWI, thus we
  can proceed to final quantification of perfusion, inverting the
  kinetics of of the ASL label delviery and using the calibration
image to get values in the units of ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>We can do the full quantification using a single call to oxford_asl
(it incorporates the asl_file subtraction process):</p>

<pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --wp --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6
  --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 -c aslcalib --tr 4.8
  </pre>

<p>
<list>Note that we have specified:
<li>The type of labeling, pcASL: <code>--casl</code>).</li>
<li>The format of the data, label-control: <code>--iaf=tc</code>).</li>
<li>The PLD, via the inflow time, which is the label durection plus
PLD for pcASL: <code>--tis=3.6</code>.</li>
<li> The label duration (<code>--bolus=1.8</code>).</li>
<li> The time to acquire each slice in the 2D EPI readout (to correct
for the difference in PLD in each slice):
<code>--slicedt=0.0452</code>.</li>
<li>The TR of the calibration data: <code>--tr=4.8</code>.</li>
</list>
</p>

<p>For this analysis we have put <code>oxford_asl</code> into 'White
Paper' mode (<code>--wp</code>), this means it uses a kinetic model and defaults for the
parameters that are consistent with the formulate in the ASL Consensus Paper.</p>

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

<p>You will find something that looks very similar to the PWI we viewed before, but now the values at every vxoel are in ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>You will also find a PWI saved as
<code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion</code>. This is very similar to the
PWI we calculated using <code>asl_file</code>, except that the kinetic
model inversion has been applied to it, this is the image
pre-calibration.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of the analysis of this data, by applying
some corrections during analysis, this is the subject of <a href="../ex2/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>.</p>
